#Tumor Classification on Breast Cells- Bening or Malign

**In this exercise we will compare the use of different classification models to classify breast tumors as benign or malignant.**

The dataset is divided into a test and a train file. The train file, the one we will use to train our models, is composed of 31 columns:

- Diagnosis column: indicates the type of tumor : benign '0' or malignant '1'.

- The rest of the columns correspond to different metrics of measurement of the tumor in medical terms.
